# Hardware modifications for RazorScope

## These are modifications applied to a standard [OpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/Welcome_to_the_OpenSPIM_Wiki) in order to:

1. Use **Nikon CFI75 LWD 16X W** objective in the detection axis
2. Add a **Sutter Lambda 10** filter wheel across the infinity tube to allow multicolor imaging

These modifications were developed in collaboration with Pieter Fourie [https://www.pfde.co.uk/](https://www.pfde.co.uk/)
